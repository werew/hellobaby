## Introduction

While studing how malwares work I realized that writing one on my own would be
a very good way to learn: *hellobaby* is my personal attempt to create a simple
multi-functional malware.

I will try to document very well every part of this project.

The principales goals are to get a better view on:

- how malwares spread
- how malwares get automatically re-executed
- how botnets work/communicate
- how modern malwares use to evade the most common detection techniques


For this *hellobaby* is composed by different modules, each of them
implementing a different technique to perform a certain task (e.g. spreading,
evasion techniques).
